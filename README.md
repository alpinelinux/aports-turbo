# aports-turbo

Alpine Linux package database written in Lua.

This application makes use of the [Turbo](https://turbo.readthedocs.io) (Lua) framework.

On Alpine Linux it should be enough to install turbo and deps by: 

```
apk add luajit lua5.1 lua-turbo lua-sqlite lua-lustache lua-socket lua-lzmq lua-gversion
```

Copy `config.sample.lua` to `config.lua` and edit it.
You can start the application by starting `./aports.lua` or on Alpine Linux with turbo's init.d (see `conf.d/turbo` for settings).

#### Creating/updating the database

aports-turbo uses an SQLite database which is generated (check config to init tables) and updated by `import.lua` found in the tools directory. `import.lua` needs to be run from the root of aports-turbo project. You can for example run it from cron by creating a file like:

/etc/periodic/15min/alpine-turbo:

```shell
#!/bin/sh

webdir="/var/www/aports-turbo"

cd $webdir && luajit tools/import.lua > /dev/null 2>&1
```
